# General Info

Landing page developed with the intent of capturing leads, as a part of a challenge proposed by Gama Academy. </br>
This page was coded in less than a week using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.

The product we created is a free e-book with tips for safe traveling after the COVID-19 pandemic. The material provides guidance for exploring destinations safely, getting informed about changes and refunds of reservations, as well as a check-list (so as not to forget any item when packing).
